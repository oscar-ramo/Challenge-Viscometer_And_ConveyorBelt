# Challenge - Viscometer and Conveyor Belt
This repository contains my contributions to the 5th semester project, along with the final technical report submitted to the supervising professors, which documents the design, implementation, and results of the work.

The project was about designing and implementing a mechatronic system combining a viscometer and a conveyor belt with three stations (stacking, measuring, sorting). The goal was to automate viscosity measurement and integrate it into a conveyor belt using microcontrollers and PLCs

The project lasted 15 weeks:
- Weeks 1-5: Project planning, research, and first draft design
- Weeks 6-10: CAD design, manufacturing, electronics design, manual control programming, and manual UI design
- Weeks 11-15: Adjustments, automatic control implementation, PCB design, full programming (manual + automatic), PLC integration.

> Note: For a complete review of the whole Challenge, please review the document `Challenge_Final__5to_Semestre` document, also included in this Repo

Main contributions:
- **Viscometer**: Full programming, LabVIEW UI design
- **Conveyor Belt**: Stack system logic design, CAD design for stack system and conveyor belt, complete electronics
- **Control**: Collaborated in implementing modularized code structure and tuning with MATLAB
- **Integration**: Connected UI with the viscometer, achieved manual measurement and visualization

Minor contributions:
- **Viscometer**: CAD corrections, assisted electronics integration and testing
