# Challenge-Viscometer_And_ConveyorBelt
This repository contains my contributions to the 5th semester project, along with the final technical report submitted to the supervising professors, which documents the design, implementation, and results of the work.

The project lasted 15 weeks:
- Weeks 1-5: Project planning, research, and first draft design
- Weeks 6-10: CAD design, electronics design, manual programming, and manual UI design
- Weeks 11-15: Adjustments, automatic programming, and automatic UI design
